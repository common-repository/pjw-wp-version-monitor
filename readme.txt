== Description ==
WordPress Version Check provides you with an easy way of checking that you are
running the most up-to-date WordPress version.  The plugin checks an XML-RPC
webservice every 15 minutes for update information and displays a message in
the admin pages.

Note this plugin is no longer useful or supported so don't bother installing it

See this blog post for more info: http://blog.ftwr.co.uk/archives/2009/05/26/retiring-wordpress-version-check/

== Installation ==

1. Upload to your plugins folder, usually `wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate the plugin on the plugin screen
3. Checking will begin immediately.
4. If you are running wp-dash you will find a new dashboard widget which
displays the update message.
